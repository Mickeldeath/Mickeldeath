- 👋 Hi, I’m Michael
- 👀 I’m interested in exploring the world of coding and software/game development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning to code for fun using FreeCodeCamp and CS50x. I began my journey in February 2024 and I'm still in the process of working through both courses.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects related to web development, game development, beginner-level coding challenges, or anything that can help me enhance my coding skills.

- ⚡ Fun fact: I'm an amateur car photographer, and I'm passionate about racing sims. At home, I've got an ASR3 chassis with a Moza r9 base, Moza SR-P pedals, and a Moza GS v2 steering wheel. Mainly into GT3 racing.
